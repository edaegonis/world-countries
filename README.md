# Front-end task of Code Challenge for Scoutbase

This task is for demonstrating your understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, React & related libraries.

If you’re doing the front-end only, you must use the https://countries.trevorblades.com endpoint for GraphQL API.

Preferred libraries:
  1. `styled-components` for styling
  2. `apollo-client` for consuming GraphQL API
  3. `react-router` or any alternative to implement routing

Instructions:

1. Create a `create-react-app` repo.
2. Add a router with routes:
  - `/` - for displaying basic links for the other routes
  - `/countries` - for requesting GraphQL API and rendering the list
  - `/countries/(:code)` - for requesting GraphQL API and rendering the properties of a continent
3. Design is totally by you.
4. Countries list at `/countries` must contain the list of countries and the languages spoken in that country. Both in English and native languages. It should also contain the continent it is located in.
5. `/countries/(:code)` must render the currency and a area code (phone) of that country.
6. Routes must be fully loadable with a direct link. `/countries/CI` must render the page for Ivory Coast, for example.
7. End.
